# Get Cryptonose 2.17

## Windows installer

<a class="download-button" href="https://github.com/dawidm/cryptonose2/releases/download/v2.17.0/Cryptonose-2.17.0.exe">Download Windows version (Cryptonose-2.17.0.exe)</a>

**Windows Defender SmartScreen** is blocking the installation? This could unfortunetly happen, because it doesn't find Cryptonose "a known application". To install Cryptonose you need to click "More info" and "Run anyway".

To fix this I would have to pay for a special certificate every year but still Windows Defender could be sceptical, because of relatively low popularity of this application.
