## What is Cryptonose?
Cryptonose is a **free and open source** desktop application that keeps track of significant price changes within small time periods (5 minutes, 30 minutes) on cryptocurrency markets. It works in real time, connecting directly to supported cryptocurrency exchanges, giving you instant alert when price rises or drops.

## Do I need Cryptonose?
You may want to try Cryptonose if you are day trader on cryptocurrency markets. I started creating Cryptonose as personal project. I've been using it in trading for over 2 years.

## The most important features of Cryptonose
* Cryptonose uses **real-time connection** to an exchange. For selected cryptocurrency pairs, it uses all exchange transactions (fills) to track the price.
* Aside from tracking percent price changes, it also tracks **relative price change**. Some currency pairs are much more volatile than others. Relative price change helps to determine when price change is significant for given currency. You can find the details in manual (link at the top of the site).
* When price change meets price alert conditions Cryptonose can: send **desktop notification**, play **sound**, **run web browser** with exchagne website.

## Supported exchanges
Currently supported exchanges: **Binance, Bitfinex, Poloniex**. Another exchanges may be added in the future, but existing ones provide data for most of popular markets, so you can use Cryptonose even if you trade on another exchange.
