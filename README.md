If you want to build Cryptonose you should install those dependencies in your local maven repository (use `mvn install`).
https://github.com/dawidm/exchangeutils  
https://github.com/dawidm/cryptonoseengine (depends on the previous one)  
https://github.com/dawidm/dmutils  
https://github.com/dawidm/minimal-fx-charts  

To run Cryptonose use `gradlew run`, to build packages/installer use `gradlew jpackage`. Use the code with the most recent git tag for the newest working version.
